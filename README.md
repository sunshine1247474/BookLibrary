**Welcome to the Book Library Project!** This is a virtual space where book collectors and people with an introductory level of code can unite with their difference of programing level, and try out, modify, rebuild this project to the next level. 

Had an idea of digital book library? want to get inspired for similar project with algorithms or just curious? 
Maybe this is the right place.

This med-complex but yet not too sophisticated graphical user interface is like a private little corner. You can review your most read genres. You are given the ability to edit the code with no prior knowledge in coding. You can edit details of your own books.

**How it works:** After you have read or become interested in a book or a topic you like, you have the option to add the details about the book to the code environment. The system acts like a knowledgeable friend, sifting through a wealth of data to find books that match your preferences.

**The Experience**: This project is not perfect. You can take it to all kinds of places. It reminds me a bit of a file folder system, but it only relies on a single JSON data file that contains information of your books as if you were to write them into notes. It has one exception though and that’s obviously has to do with the fact that windows or any other operating system will not have favorites section in the file system (rather you can create a manual folder containing double the amount of data)...

The idea is that any developer can edit this interactive library on his own with little or no knowledge in algorithms. You can improve this GUI, search mechanism, or even add some extra features like adding to the terminal an AI to help you find a book that doesn't exist in your library and automatically download details about it into your library instead of adding information manually after each book you’ve read.

**Getting Started:** Download the file or copy paste it into your favorite coding environment and enjoy :p
