Hey everyone! Welcome to my project, which is all about creating a virtual library for your favorite books. This folder is where all the magic happens. It’s set up to help you find books you’ll love, based on what you tell it.

Here’s how it works:

Your Input: You start by typing in a book or topic you like.
The Library: The system then searches through a bunch of data to find matches.
The Suggestions: After that, it gives you a list of books that you might want to check out.
It’s like having a chat with a friend who knows all about books and always has the best recommendations. So, dive in and discover your next great read!
